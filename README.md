# Bookstore

Welcome to the Book Store Application! This project is built using Python and Django, offering users a simple and intuitive way to browse through a variety of books. With features like registration and authentication, users can easily manage their interactions with the platform. Administrators have access to an admin interface for efficiently managing the bookstore's inventory. Additionally, the API section provides convenient access to book data for developers and enthusiasts. 

To get started with the Book Store Application, follow these simple steps:

User Interface: After cloning the repository and setting up the project, users can register for a new account or sign in with existing credentials. Once logged in, users can explore the collection of books available in the store and read detailed descriptions for each book.

Admin Interface: As an administrator, access the admin dashboard by logging in with the superuser credentials created during setup. From the admin interface, you can manage the book collection by adding, editing, or deleting books as necessary.

API: Utilize the API endpoints provided by the application to access book data programmatically. The API endpoint for retrieving all books is available at http://localhost:8000/api/books/, while searching for a specific book by its ID can be done using the endpoint http://localhost:8000/api/books/<book_id>/.
