Welcome to the Book Store Application! This project is designed to provide users with a seamless experience in browsing through a collection of books, registering, and signing in to manage their interactions. Additionally, administrators have access to a comprehensive admin interface for managing books, while everyone can utilize the API section to fetch book data conveniently.

To get started with the Book Store Application, follow these simple steps:

User Interface: After cloning the repository and setting up the project, users can register for a new account or sign in with existing credentials. Once logged in, users can explore the collection of books available in the store and read detailed descriptions for each book.

Admin Interface: As an administrator, access the admin dashboard by logging in with the superuser credentials created during setup. From the admin interface, you can manage the book collection by adding, editing, or deleting books as necessary.

API: Utilize the API endpoints provided by the application to access book data programmatically. The API endpoint for retrieving all books is available at http://localhost:8000/api/books/, while searching for a specific book by its ID can be done using the endpoint http://localhost:8000/api/books/<book_id>/.
